2. create your owned folder under `webapp`, naming convention follows Java variable naming convention, e..g `appName`.
If you encounter a name conflict, add your name as a prefix like `authorNameAppName`.
3. put all your required resources (js, css) under your owned folder) to avoid affecting other contesttants'.
4. complete your handlers. Java package name convention is `org.zkoss.handlers.authorname.appname`.
